//I used a comparison operator == to show the cart when the cart has 1 item in it
//I used an if statement to say only show the cart if length is exactly  equal to 1.



//This tells the notice to hide when a new item was added to the cart
$("#notice").hide();

//This says if a row with id cart has been added and is equal to 1 row show the cart
if ($('#cart tr').length == 1) { $('#cart').show('blind', 1000); }

//This finds the id with cart and outputs the html in the cart
//The j escapes JavaScript
$('#cart').html("<%=j render @cart %>");
//This make the most recent item added to the 
//carts background stay the dark blue, but 
//change the background to dark pink temerarily, until another item is added
//or the page is reloaded
$('#current_item').css({'background-color':'#5E7F8C'}).
	animate({'background-color':'#8C4F5A'}, 1000);

//I used the jQuery effect hide to hide the cart until there is 1 or more items 
//in the cart and then I used the jQuery effect to show the cart.  I used blind
//and 1000 to slowly make the cart appear.  I used .html() to manipulate the 
//dom and insert the html cart information.  Then I used .css() to keep the 
//background blue, but then used the jQuery effect animate() to make the background pink briefly.
